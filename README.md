## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS fundamentals
-   CSS alignment (Flexbox)
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although this project require little html and css but it is a good place to start for me. This little project gives me the oppurtunity to experiment with CSS alignment(flexbox).

### Continued development

I will love to focus on HTML5 basic and semantic Tags(page layout), CSS fundamentals, CSS alignment(flexbox, CSS grid), Media queries and responsive design, simple animations and transitions.
